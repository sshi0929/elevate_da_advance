## 1\. Executive Summary & Pilot Objectives

Cymbal Retail is a global electronics retailer operating 500+ physical storefronts and a global e-commerce portal. Currently running on an AWS & Databricks data platform, they face escalating cross-cloud data egress fees, high Apache Spark infrastructure management overhead, 24-hour batch latencies that create inventory blind spots and checkout shrinkage as well as inability to have agentic workflows on multi-modal data sources (structured \+ unstructured).

The objective of this pilot is to deploy a Google Cloud Agentic Data Cloud platform solution that gives them an open-format supported  lakehouse federation, streaming intelligence, and a conversational AI self-service analytics portal. 

* **Eliminate Data Silos:** Transition from fragmented, duplicated reporting tables to a unified, open data lakehouse architecture that enables in-place querying across retail domains without physical data replication or staging.  
* **Achieve Real-Time Operational Visibility:** Replace 24-hour batch reporting latencies with continuous streaming intelligence, providing store managers and POS checkout applications with near real time lookups for order anomalies and cashier promotion abuse.  
* **Unlock Insights from Dark Data:** Ingest and vectorize dark unstructured PDF POS technical manuals and warranty documents into an interactive, grounded conversational knowledge base for instant shop-floor hardware troubleshooting.  
* **Enable Conversational Self-Service Analytics:** Empower store managers and supply chain planners to query net profit margins, available-to-promise (ATP) inventory, and warranty triaging using natural language without writing complex SQL or navigating fragmented BI tools.  
* **Validate Multi-System Orchestration:** Demonstrate the capability to chain actions across structured historical data, real-time alert streams, and unstructured technical manuals to solve complex retail workflows (e.g., checkout warranty triage, order anomaly risk detection), serving as a critical evaluation benchmark for prototype success before scaling.  
* **Collaborative Notebook Workspace**: interactive, multi-language notebooks for data science prototyping.  
* **Open Storage Paradigm**: open-format tables (Apache Iceberg) on cloud object storage, no proprietary lock-in.  
* **Ensure Enterprise Governance & Security:** Maintain 100% visibility over data certification and lineage, for e.g., enforce row-level security per Store Manager, and automatically mask customer payment card numbers across all conversational turns and query logs.

## 2\. Project Scope (Pilot)

### 2.1. Functional Scope 

* Conversational User Interface (UI): Web-based chat portal allowing store staff to query structured, unstructured, and live streaming data using natural language.  
* Lakehouse Federation & Serverless Spark: Zero-copy querying of S3 Iceberg tables via Cross-cloud lakehouse, and Serverless Spark ETL for nightly inventory reconciliation.  
* Streaming Intelligence: Real time ingestion of POS transactions, sliding-window cashier promotion override aggregations, low-latency real-time transaction anomaly and promotion abuse scoring, and near real time point lookups.  
* Document Q\&A (RAG): Grounded Q\&A over PDF product catalogs, system repair manuals, and warranty documents with source citations.  
* Enterprise Governance & Security: Knowledge Catalog metadata, row-level security per Store Manager token, and dynamic payment card PII masking.

### 2.2. Data Scope 

* Unstructured Documents: PDF POS terminal manuals, and warranty documents in an AWS S3 bucket.  
* Batch data:  
  * Retail Iceberg Dimensions & Fact Tables (via REST Catalog): Customer, Product, Demographics, Supplier, Inventory & Sales order data (Silver conformed fact table)   
  * Gold aggregate fact table (via REST Catalog): Containing daily store metrics.  
  * POS Transactional Telemetry: Daily POS transaction dumps. You will need to build data pipelines on this data for downstream use.   
* Real time POS stream: A Kafka topic containing POS transactions, sent in real-time from 50 stores. Transactions are sent as JSON strings with identifiers for store, cashier, POS terminal and customer, item basket details and payment details.

### 2.3. Out of Scope for Pilot

* Direct Multi-Cloud Write-Backs: All connections to AWS S3 and regional store databases are strictly read-only.  
* Multi-Language & Telephony: Non-English languages, IVR, and VoIP telephony hooks are excluded.  
* Production Enterprise SSO Sync: Uses functional GCP test service accounts and mock JWT identity headers instead of live Okta/AD sync.

## 3\. Current State Architecture 

### 3.1. Core Systems & Platform Components

* Lakehouse Storage (AWS S3): Raw, semi-structured, and curated datasets in open Apache Iceberg format.  
* Batch & Interactive Compute: Databricks (on AWS) Spark clusters for nightly ETL; vectorized SQL engine for BI queries.  
* Unified Governance Catalog: AWS Glue Data Catalog managing schemas, tables, and column/row permissions.  
* Data Science Workspace: Collaborative Jupyter-style notebooks for demand forecasting prototyping.  
* Enterprise BI Layer: Tableau serving daily executive dashboards.

### 3.2. Core Operational Workloads

* POS Sales Deduplication & Aggregation: Ingests daily POS files from 500+ stores, reconciles promotional discounts, removes duplicate/late-arriving records, and emits flash sales summaries.  
* Nightly Inventory Conformance: Normalizes shelf and backroom stock counts across 500+ store locations into a single daily conformed snapshot.  
* Demand Forecasting ML Features: Distributed Spark jobs building customer feature tables for demand forecasting models.

### 3.3. End-to-End Current State Data Lineage

Operational POS logs, store inventories, and supplier PDFs flow through AWS S3 landing buckets into Medallion layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold), cataloged in AWS Glue Data Catalog, queried via the AWS SQL engine, and consumed by Tableau/Power BI dashboards.
